# FrorgBattle Alpha Version 4
Welcome to full rewrite number four of my turn based battle engine. This time, it'll be an actual engine - data driven, component based, actual UI (sorry frorgV3 😔), you name it. JUST ONE MORE REFACTOR I SWEAR 🙏

The following sections are the promises I'm making for what FrorgBattleV4 is to be.

## JSON Support
Fully data driven! You can write any character, ability, effect, and maybe more using a JSON schema that I will describe somewhere. FrorgBattle API gonna go crazy ngl.

## Component Based
Before, I'd been doing more OOP than composition. It sorta worked, but now that I want more expandability, JSON support, and especially modularity, I'm moving to components because it makes a lot more sense.

## Graphical User Interface
This was suppposed to come in FrorgV3, but I unfortunately got stuck refactoring abilities before I got to finish it. I've learned quite a bit, though, and now I can do it with a few less headaches than before. Point is - GUI !!! Very useful for something like this. Also, fully modular as well. You don't have to use my GUI implementation if you don't like it. Just make a mod for a custom UI. Wait, what's that?

## Modding support
Okay, I'm getting ahead of myself. This *is* planned, but in the future. It's a dateless "I will do it". It's a promise, but not a very soon-to-be one.

## Conclusion
My biggest project yet, bigger than my biggest project that was bigger than my biggest project bigger than my biggest project at the time. The purpose of FrorgBattle has remained the same throughout the iterations - make something me and other people can enjoy. Even despite all the hurdles, I can't claim I didn't have fun doing my billion reworks. Though it is a lot more fun to just make characters.
